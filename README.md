### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space
EXAMPLE README 

Hackers den is inspired by both the martix film franchises numner athetic (by production designer Simon Whiteley) as wwell as the hacker athetic that came along with it. The intention of this code is primary to be used a background for desktops or Zoom or other background software comptabale apps. 

In terms of preformance it utilizes p5js noise as a background element and ease as a foreground element. The noise works as a background inspred by computer binary digits (0s,and 1s), moving in a synced manor, inspired by the classic matrix openining crawl. The noise is the computer code in a scrolling down montion. thus is inspired by hackertyper.net, as well as my own genral notion of scrolling through code. This creates an illusion of a use scrolling through code as its used as a background. 

In terms on design the background is more directly based off the matrix, while the foreground layout is based off a stock image I found online (https://www.videvo.net/video/computer-code-flythrough-loop/4519/), the direct influence is hack typer (https://hackertyper.net) This commuter code was fitting with the matrix aethetic as it gives of the classic image of a hacker, fitting for a zoom background. The black, white and green is a design choice also a direct influence of the classic matrix look.
